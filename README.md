#### Copyright (c) 2013 - Alexander Hiam - <ahiam@marlboro.edu>

This is the start of a reflow oven control program, intended for use with
converted toaster ovens. It currently runs on the BeagleBone using 
[PyBBIO](https://github.com/alexanderhiam/PyBBIO), but will eventually 
support more platforms. It uses a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
based web interface, with realtime temperature data plotted using 
[Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/).

Not everything is working quite right yet, and anything is bound to change;
use at your own risk!
